# ScrewPlate #
Customizable widget templates for [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/)

## 🚀&nbsp; Introduction
**ScrewPlate** is intended to be a collection of widget templates. The focus of the widgets should be on customizability so that a harmonized design can be easily created and no more customizations need to be made in the widget code.
